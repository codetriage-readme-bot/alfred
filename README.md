say.hello:
    summary: I will say hello!
    usage: alfred say.hello
    command: echo "Hello!"

say.howareyou:
    summary: I will ask how you are
    usage: alfred say.howareyou
    command: |
        echo "How"
        echo "Are"
        echo "You?"

speak:

`alfred` Will show you all of the available tasks and a quick summary.

`alfred say.hello` Will simply say hello

`alfred say.howareyou` Will ask how you are

`alfred speak` will perform both tasks in the specified order

`alfred blurt` will perform both tasks at the same time
